# E-Compost-project
This report focuses on the development and implementation of an electronic composter "E-Compost" as an innovative and sustainable solution for managing organic waste generated at free fairs and markets in Chile. The main objective of this project is to reduce the environmental impact associated with this waste by promoting efficient and controlled composting practices.

The report addresses the origin stages and its four sub-stages, profile and its four sub-stages, and pre-feasibility and its first two sub-stages of an engineering project, following a comprehensive evaluation approach and applying the contents provided by the teacher.

In the origin stage, research tools were used to identify the problem of organic waste generation at free fairs and markets. Subsequently, alternatives and/or satisfiers were sought, and comparisons and analyses were conducted to find the optimal solution, in this case, the electronic composter.

In the profile stage, a detailed market analysis was conducted in the different sub-stages of: approximate calculation of the total investment amount, calculation of the minimum profitability, approximate calculation of the sum of income and the sum of expenses, and the approximate calculation of the project's profitability (whether social or economic), where the project's economic aspects were evaluated, considering investment costs, expected income, and profitability, among others.

In the pre-feasibility stage, an analysis of the project's technical, legal, environmental, and financial aspects was carried out. Additionally, a study of the supplier, competitor, and consumer markets was conducted to ensure the project's success and viability.

As a result of this report, it has been determined that the implementation of the electronic composter is a viable and promising solution for managing organic waste at free fairs and markets. Furthermore, a consumer market interested in adopting sustainable practices and committed to reducing their environmental impact has been identified.
